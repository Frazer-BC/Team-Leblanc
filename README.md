## Features



## Design

-   ### Images
    - The Hero Image was chosen for it's vibrance and universal appeal. It quickly and clearly conveys the common themes and style which can be found across the artist's portfolio. It's bright and eye catching, without being too busy or overly complicated. It radiates warmth and cultural pride for New Orleans while it sets the tone for what the user can expect to find in the gallery.

    - The Gallery images, as well as the Hero image and the image of the artist on the about page were generated by inputting detailed prompts into [Microsoft Designer](https://create.microsoft.com/en-us/features/ai-image-generator) and the best creations were then selected for the project. The Gallery is split into two sections Cultural pieces, and Commercial pieces to reflect the diversity of the artist's portfolio. The Cultural pieces are inspired by various elements of New Orleans history and culture, such as Mardi Gras, The New Orleans Saints, The Fleur de lis, and Jazz music among other things. The Commercial pieces introduce a new direction for the artist and include wall murals for small local businesses such as Tattoo parlours, fast food restaurants, Cajun restaurants, and bars.

    - The background image behind the reviews on the home page was generated using [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/). The beautiful sunset backdrop of The New Orleans Skyline across lake Pontchartrain sets the scene and lends a cool urban feel to the home page. It implies that the artist is renowned across the whole city.

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  The colour scheme we chose for this website was inspired by the artwork itself. The colours were suggested by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) when asked to create a pallette that complimented the hero image. 

-   ### Typography
    - The majority of the font for the website is white in colour, as this improves accessibility with the chosen backgrounds images and background colours. Google Fonts were used to import Permanent Marker and East Sea Dotko fonts into the project. These were chosen as they reflect the style and personality of the street artist, whilst still being clear and easy to read.
