## Features

### Existing Features

-  #### Navigation Bar

- The Navigation bar features consistently across all 4 pages, providing quick and simple navigation from anywhere on the site. The header containing the navbar is fixed, allowing the user to travel from page to page without having to scroll back to the top. This helps creates a positive user experience.

![navigation-bar](/assets/documentation/featureheader.png)

- #### Hero image and tagline

- The hero image is bright and vibrant. It's instantly eye-catching and draws the user in immediately. It demonstrates the artist's typical styles and themes so that the general user can decide whether they want to see more of the artist's work and the prospective customer can get an idea of whether or not the artist's work would suit their business needs. The tagline is warm and inviting, it uses alliteration in the slogan whilst reinforcing the themes of culture and community which are central to the artist and her artwork.

![Hero-image](/assets/documentation/featurehero.png)

- #### Review Section

- The review section serves as a helpful tool in promoting the artist to the user. Seeing the positive reactions to the artist's work can encourage prospective customers to explore the site further and potentially submit a request via the contact form.

![review-section](/assets/documentation/featurereview.png)

- #### The footer

- The footer contains all the social media links attributed to the artist. It features on every page so that users can quickly and easily access Mara's facebook, isnstagram, Youtube or Twitter account. The social media pages all open in new tabs so that the user is not redirected from the artist's website. This is another feature that helps create a positive user experience.

![footer](/assets/documentation/featurefooter.png)

- #### The Gallery

- A gallery is a perfect way for any artist to showcase their work, and is therefore a key feature on Mara's website. The gallery is divided into two seperate sections, one that demonstrates her cultural pieces and another that showcases her commercial projects. Keeping them separate improves the user experience, particularly for prospective customers who want to see what work Mara has done for other local businesses as they can now find these images straight away as they are not scattered amongst the other murals.

![Gallery](/assets/documentation/featuregallery.png)

- #### The Contact form

- The contact form is another integral feature for the website. It allows prospective customers to reach out to Mara to request a commission. She can then use the submitted information in the form to contact the prospective customer with a quote for the planned work.

![Contact](/assets/documentation/featurecontact.png)

- #### The About page

- The About page allows the user to learn more about the artist behind the art. The page features a picture of a smiling young woman with paint splatters on her skin and clothes. This makes Mara seem down to earth, warm, approachable and passionate about creating art. These are all qualities that a prospective customer might find appealing, which again creates a positive user experience. The picture of the artist also establishes Mara as a real person and helps to foster a human connection with the user, as they now might feel more inclined to support Mara's business knowing that she isn't a big faceless corporation or a robot. The informative and detailed artist biography also supports this idea and contributes to a positive user experience.

![About](/assets/documentation/featureabout.png)

### Future Features

- #### Background Music

- Jazz Music playing in the background would really compliment the art style and theme. As long as it is not set to autoplay and the user has a control button to turn the sound on and off, then this might improve the user experience. However it's not a neccesary feature so it can wait for a future update.

## Design

-   ### Images
- The Hero Image was chosen for it's vibrance and universal appeal. It quickly and clearly conveys the common themes and style which can be found across the artist's portfolio. It's bright and eye catching, without being too busy or overly complicated. It radiates warmth and cultural pride for New Orleans while it sets the tone for what the user can expect to find in the gallery.

- The Gallery images, as well as the Hero image and the image of the artist on the about page were generated by inputting detailed prompts into [Microsoft Designer](https://create.microsoft.com/en-us/features/ai-image-generator) and the best creations were then selected for the project. The Gallery is split into two sections Cultural pieces, and Commercial pieces to reflect the diversity of the artist's portfolio. The Cultural pieces are inspired by various elements of New Orleans history and culture, such as Mardi Gras, The New Orleans Saints, The Fleur de lis, and Jazz music among other things. The Commercial pieces introduce a new direction for the artist and include wall murals for small local businesses such as Tattoo parlours, fast food restaurants, Cajun restaurants, and bars.

- The background image behind the reviews on the home page was generated using [Vecteezy](https://vecteezy.com). The beautiful sunset backdrop of The New Orleans Skyline across lake Pontchartrain sets the scene and lends a cool urban feel to the home page. It implies that the artist is renowned across the whole city.

-   ### Colour Scheme
-  The colour scheme we chose for this website was inspired by the artwork itself. The colours were suggested by [Coolors](https://coolors.co) when asked to create a pallette that complimented the hero image.

-   ### Typography
- The majority of the font for the website is white in colour, as this improves accessibility with the chosen backgrounds images and background colours. Google Fonts were used to import Permanent Marker and East Sea Dotko fonts into the project. These were chosen as they reflect the style and personality of the street artist, whilst still being clear and easy to read.

### Browser Compatibility

- Testing has been carried out on the following browsers :
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge

### Known Bugs

- Contact Page form appears to overflow when tested on responsive dimensions at certain breakpoints, particularly small phone screens.

![contact-page-bug](/assets/documentation/bug1.png)

However, the bug does not seem to appear when tested on particular phone models with similar dimensions. Although they still do not look as aesthetically pleasing as intended.

![contact-page-layout](/assets/documentation/bug2.png)

### Responsive design

- Apart from this one bug, the project appears to be very responsive after testing and while improvements could be made to make it more asethetically pleasing in future, it is otherwise functional across all tested platforms and browsers.
